# Day 2 Review Activity: My Personal Info Generator
# ----------------------------------------

print(" Welcome to the Python Review Activity!")
print("You’ll review variables, strings, numbers, and print formatting.\n")

# Step 1: Create Variables
# TODO: Replace the values below with your own info
first_name = "Anthony"
age = 16
favorite_color = "Purple"
favorite_number = 4

#  Step 2: Practice String Operations
# 1. Print your name in uppercase
print(first_name. upper())

# 2. Print how many letters are in your name
print(len(first_name))

# 3. Combine your name and favorite color into one message
message = first_name + " and " + favorite_color
print("Name and Favorite Color:", message)
#  Step 3: Math Practice
# Use arithmetic operators with your favorite number
num1 = 4
num2 = 10
sum_result = num1 + num2
print("The sum of this is:", sum_result)

#  Step 4: User Input Practice
# Ask the user two questions and combine answers




# ⚙️ Step 5: Final Challenge (combine it all)
# Use math and strings together

print(f"Hello, This is my name and my favorite color, {message}.  I am {age} years old. My favorite subject is math. I can easily do math such as 4+10. That would be {sum_result}")
